## 🧬 Engineering Workflow

Every case study in this repository follows a rigorous analytical framework:
1. **Data Acquisition:** Sourcing and cleaning raw datasets.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing distributions and correlations to find hidden patterns.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Scaling, encoding, and selecting the most impactful variables.
4. **Model Selection:** Comparing algorithms (Random Forest, SVM, KNN, etc.) to find the best fit.
5. **Evaluation:** Tuning hyperparameters and analyzing Confusion Matrices and ROC curves.
