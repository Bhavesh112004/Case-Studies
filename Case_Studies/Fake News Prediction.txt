TF-IDf Vectorizor :
			TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) converts text documents into numerical feature vectors.
It highlights words that are frequent in a given document but not frequent across all documents

Doc1: "the sky is blue"
Doc2: "the sun is bright"
Doc3: "the sun in the sky is bright"

(a) Tokenization

Doc1 → [the, sky, is, blue]

Doc2 → [the, sun, is, bright]

Doc3 → [the, sun, in, the, sky, is, bright]

(b) Vocabulary (unique terms)
[the, sky, is, blue, sun, bright, in]

c) Term Frequency (TF)

TF = (Count of term in document) / (Total terms in document)

Term	Doc1 (4 words)	Doc2 (4 words)	Doc3 (7 words)
the	1/4=0.25	1/4=0.25	2/7≈0.2857
sky	1/4=0.25	0		1/7≈0.1429
is	1/4=0.25	1/4=0.25	1/7≈0.1429
blue	1/4=0.25	0		0
sun	0		1/4=0.25	1/7≈0.1429
bright	0		1/4=0.25	1/7≈0.1429
in	0		0		1/7≈0.1429


(d) Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)

IDF = log( N / (1 + df) )
(N = total docs = 3, df = number of docs containing the term)

Term	df	IDF
the	3	log(3/4)= -0.125 (≈0 if floored)
sky	2	log(3/3)=0
is	3	log(3/4)= -0.125 (≈0 if floored)
blue	1	log(3/2)=0.405
sun	2	log(3/3)=0
bright	2	log(3/3)=0
in	1	log(3/2)=0.405

(Most libraries use log((1+N)/(1+df)) + 1 to keep positives.)



(e) Compute TF-IDF = TF × IDF

Example:

For Doc1, “blue”: TF=0.25 × IDF=0.405 = 0.10125

For Doc1, “sky”: TF=0.25 × IDF=0 = 0

Compute this for all terms in all docs.



(f) Build the TF-IDF Vectors

Vector order = [the, sky, is, blue, sun, bright, in]

Doc1: [0, 0, 0, 0.101, 0, 0, 0]

Doc2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.101] (numbers depend on formula used)

Doc3: [values per term]

This matrix is the input for machine learning models.




Stage		What Happens					Example
Tokenization	Break text into words			“the sky is blue” → [the, sky, is, blue]
Vocabulary	Unique terms from all docs			[the, sky, is, blue, sun, bright, in]
TF		Term frequency per doc			sky: 1/4=0.25
IDF		Penalize common words			IDF(blue)=0.405
TF×IDF		Multiply TF×IDF				blue=0.25×0.405=0.101
